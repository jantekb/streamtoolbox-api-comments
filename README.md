# wowzatoolbox-api-comments

This is not the official Wowza Streaming Engine Server Side API. These are just my own comments to that, provided as-is, without any warranty.
I think that these might be useful for people starting developing custom modules for Wowza. If you do, you might be interested [in this tutorial](https://wowzatoolbox.com/hello-wowza-module-tutorial).

If you find errors in this document or have anything to add, feel free to contribute.

The generated javadoc from these sources are available here in HTML format: https://wowzatoolbox.com/api-comments
