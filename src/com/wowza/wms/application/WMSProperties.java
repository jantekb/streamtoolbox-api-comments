/**
 * This class wraps the properties that you can define for your server, application, etc. It is acting more or less like a {@link java.util.Map}
 * A typical example is the Application.xml file's @{code Properties} section. 
 * Some interesting material about prefixing properties: http://wejn.com/blog/2013/04/on-multiple-wowza-module-instances/
 * 
 * This article is an other highly recommended one, which reveals a security issue related to these properties:
 * http:/-/wejn.com/blog/2013/04/why-you-should-keep-properties-and-logging-modules-out-of-your-application-dot-xml/
 * 
 * This class is farily documented in the official docs, so I have no comments to add to it.
